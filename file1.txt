ðŸš€ Summary
âœ” Changing git config user.name does not affect authentication.
âœ” Your Git is logged in as saifakh06, but you need to authenticate as saifakh0604.
âœ” Clear credentials using git credential reject https://github.com.
âœ” If 2FA is enabled, use a Personal Access Token (PAT) instead of a password.
âœ” For a better experience, switch to SSH authentication.

Let me know if you need further help! ðŸš€
